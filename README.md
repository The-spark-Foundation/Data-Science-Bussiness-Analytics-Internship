# The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program

This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks with videos from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program).
As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the June 2021 batch.

## Tools/IDE : Python/Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook

## Technical : Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. </br>
<li>Dataset for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/The-spark-Foundation/Data-Science-Bussiness-Analytics-Internship/blob/main/Task1/Task_1_TSF(Supervised%20Learning-Prediction).ipynb">Task_1_Code</a>.</br>
<li>Video for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://youtu.be/jYAHZnnezSw">Task_1_Video</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

## Technical : Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.
I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. </br>
<li>Dataset for this model can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/The-spark-Foundation/Data-Science-Bussiness-Analytics-Internship/blob/main/Task2/Task_2_TSF(UnSupervised%20Learning-Prediction).ipynb">Task_2_Code</a>.</br>
<li>Video for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://youtu.be/DFshCNsB90Q">Task_2_Video</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.

## Technical : Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)
### Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
I will be doing this with the help of python libraries i.e. matplotlib, plotly, plotnine and seaborn. 
<li>Dataset can be found at : https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/The-spark-Foundation/Data-Science-Bussiness-Analytics-Internship/blob/main/Task3/Task_3_TSF(Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Retail).ipynb">Task_3_Code</a>.</br>
<li>Video for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://youtu.be/3MlSYmk5L6I">Task_3_Video</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
As a business manager, we will try to find out the weak areas where we can work tomake more profit. Also, what all business problems can be derived by exploring the data.

## Technical : Task 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)
### Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
I will be doing this with the help of seaborn, plotly and folium libraries in python. 
<li>Dataset can be found at : https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/The-spark-Foundation/Data-Science-Bussiness-Analytics-Internship/blob/main/Task4/Task_4_TSF(Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Terrorism).ipynb">Task_4_Code</a>.</br>
<li>Video for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://youtu.be/679rAU1ppaM">Task_4_Video</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
As a security/defense analyst, we will try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. Also, what all security issues and insights can be derived by EDA.
